# Misc
 Miscellaneous small scripts/programs

## PowerShell Scripts
### QtTsXlf
The script basicly allow you to retrive all strings in Qt which were used under translate(), save it as .ts file and after saving it as .xlf file.
This is useful in case you want strict module separation

## C/C++ Console
### OwnRegExp
Compile with C++17!
I ve been tired of even thinking doing this manually so made this for taking xlf files and read strings to another file with diffrent code structure (Not XML-like code structure). May be later will be moved to job's project.
